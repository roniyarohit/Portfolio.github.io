<!-- In HTML alone, you cannot create a delete functionality. HTML is a markup language used for creating the structure and content of a webpage. It does not have any built-in programming capabilities.

To implement a delete functionality, you will need to use a server-side programming language such as PHP, Python, or Ruby. You will also need a database to store the data that you want to delete.

Here's an example of how to create a delete functionality using PHP and MySQL:

Create a database table that contains the data you want to delete. For example: -->

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

<!-- Create a PHP script that connects to the database and retrieves the data to be deleted. For example: -->

<?php
// Connect to the database
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "myDB";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
  die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

// Check if the delete button has been clicked
if (isset($_POST['delete'])) {
  $id = $_POST['id'];

  // Delete the user with the specified ID
  $sql = "DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $id";
  if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "Record deleted successfully";
  } else {
    echo "Error deleting record: " . $conn->error;
  }
}

// Retrieve the list of users
$sql = "SELECT id, name, email FROM users";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

// Close the database connection
$conn->close();
?>

<!-- In the above code, we first connect to the database and check if the delete button has been clicked. If it has, we retrieve the ID of the user to be deleted from the $_POST superglobal array and execute a SQL DELETE statement to remove the user from the database.

We also retrieve the list of users from the database and display them in an HTML table with a delete button for each user. When the delete button is clicked, the ID of the corresponding user is passed to the $_POST array and the form is submitted.

Modify your HTML code to include a form for deleting users. For example: -->

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ID</th>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Email</th>
    <th></th>
  </tr>
  <?php while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) { ?>
    <tr>
      <td><?php echo $row['id']; ?></td>
      <td><?php echo $row['name']; ?></td>
      <td><?php echo $row['email']; ?></td>
      <td>
        <form method="post">
          <input type="hidden" name="id" value="<?php echo $row['id']; ?>">
          <button type="submit" name="delete">Delete</button>
        </form>
      </td>
    </tr>
  <?php } ?>
</table>
<!-- 
In the above code, we display the list of users in an HTML table using a while loop that iterates over the result set from the database query. For each user, we display their ID, name, and email in separate table cells.

We also include a form for deleting each user, with a hidden input field that stores the ID of the user to be deleted. When the delete button is clicked, -->
